            <p>At this point, we've looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style text, and how to style and manipulate the
                boxes that your content sits inside. Now it's time to look at how to correctly arrange your boxes in
                relation to the viewport as well as to one another. We've covered the necessary prerequisites, so let's
                dive deep into CSS layout, looking at such various features as: different display settings, positioning,
                modern layout tools like flexbox and CSS grid, and some of the legacy techniques you might still want to
                know about.</p>
            <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
            <p>Before starting this module, you should already:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Have basic familiarity with HTML, as discussed in the Introduction to HTML module.</li>
                <li>Be comfortable with CSS fundamentals, as discussed in Introduction to CSS.</li>
                <li>Understand how to style boxes.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Introduction_to_CSS_layout">
            <header>Introduction to CSS layout</header>
            <p>This article will recap some of the CSS layout features we've already touched upon in previous modules,
                such as different display values, as well as introduce some of the concepts we'll be covering throughout
                this module.</p>
            <p>CSS page layout techniques allow us to take elements contained in a web page and control where they're
                positioned relative to the following factors: their default position in normal layout flow, the other
                elements around them, their parent container, and the main viewport/window. The page layout techniques
                we'll be covering in more detail in this module are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Normal flow</li>
                <li>The display property</li>
                <li>Flexbox</li>
                <li>Grid</li>
                <li>Floats</li>
                <li>Positioning</li>
                <li>Table layout</li>
                <li>Multiple-column layout</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Normal_Flow">
            <header>Normal Flow</header>
            <p>Normal flow is how the browser lays out HTML pages by default when you do nothing to control page layout.
                Let's look at a quick HTML example:</p>
            <code>
                p {
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    background: rgb(255 84 104 / 30%);
                    <br>
                    border: 2px solid rgb(255 84 104);
                    <br>
                    padding: 10px;
                    <br>
                    margin: 10px;
                    <br>
                    <br>
                  } 
                  <br>
                  body {
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    width: 500px;
                    <br>
                    margin: 0 auto;
                    <br>
                    <br>
                  }   
            </code>




        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Flexbox">

            <header>Flexbox</header>

            <p>Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for arranging items in rows or columns. Items flex (expand) to
                fill additional space or shrink to fit into smaller spaces. This article explains all the fundamentals.
            </p>
            <h3>Why Flexbox?</h3>
            <p>For a long time, the only reliable cross-browser compatible tools available for creating CSS layouts were
                features like floats and positioning. These work, but in some ways they're also limiting and
                frustrating.</p>
            <p>The following simple layout designs are either difficult or impossible to achieve with such tools in any
                kind of convenient, flexible way:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.</li>
                <li>Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height,
                    regardless of how much width/height is available.</li>
                <li>Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a
                    different amount of content.</li>
            </ul>
            <code>
                section {
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    display: flex;
                    <br>
                flex-direction: column;
                  <br>
                flex-wrap: wrap;
                <br>
                <br>
            }
            </code>

        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Grid">
            <header>Grid</header>
            <p>A grid is a collection of horizontal and vertical lines creating a pattern against which we can line up
                our design elements. They help us to create layouts in which our elements won't jump around or change
                width as we move from page to page, providing greater consistency on our websites.</p>
            <p>A grid will typically have columns, rows, and then gaps between each row and column. The gaps are
                commonly referred to as gutters.</p>
            <code>
                .container {
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    display: grid;
                    <br>
                    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
                    <br>
                    grid-auto-rows: 100px;
                    <br>
                    gap: 20px;
                    <br>
                    <br>
                  }
            </code>
            <p>The rules for grid-template-areas are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You need to have every cell of the grid filled.
                </li>
                <li>To span across two cells, repeat the name.</li>
                <li>To leave a cell empty, use a <mark>.</mark> (period).</li>
                <li>Areas must be rectangular — for example, you can't have an L-shaped area.</li>
                <li>Areas can't be repeated in different locations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can play around with our layout, changing the footer to only sit underneath the article and the
                sidebar to span all the way down. This is a very nice way to describe a layout because it's clear just
                from looking at the CSS to know exactly what's happening.</p>

        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Float" >
            <header>Float</header>
            <p>
                The float property was introduced to allow web developers to implement layouts involving an image
                floating inside a column of text, with the text wrapping around the left or right of it. The kind of
                thing you might get in a newspaper layout.
            </p>
            <p>But web developers quickly realized that you can float anything, not just images, so the use of float
                broadened, for example, to fun layout effects such as drop-caps.</p>
            <p>Floats have commonly been used to create entire website layouts featuring multiple columns of information
                floated so they sit alongside one another (the default behavior would be for the columns to sit below
                one another in the same order as they appear in the source). There are newer, better layout techniques
                available. Using floats in this way should be regarded as a legacy technique.</p>
            <code>
                .box {
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    float: left;
                    <br>
                    margin-right: 15px;
                    <br>
                    width: 150px;
                    <br>
                    height: 100px;
                    <br>
                    border-radius: 5px;
                    <br>
                    background-color: rgb(207 232 220);
                    <br>
                    padding: 1em;
                    <br>
                    <br>
                  }  
            </code>
            <p>You now know all there is to know about floats in modern web development. See the article on legacy
                layout methods for information on how they used to be used, which may be useful if you find yourself
                working on older projects.</p>

        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Positioning">
            <header>Positioning</header>
            <p>Positioning allows you to take elements out of normal document flow and make them behave differently, for
                example, by sitting on top of one another or by always remaining in the same place inside the browser
                viewport. This article explains the different position values and how to use them.</p>

            <p>Positioning allows us to produce interesting results by overriding normal document flow. What if you want
                to slightly alter the position of some boxes from their default flow position to give a slightly quirky,
                distressed feel? Positioning is your tool. Or what if you want to create a UI element that floats over
                the top of other parts of the page and/or always sits in the same place inside the browser window no
                matter how much the page is scrolled? Positioning makes such layout work possible.</p>
            <p>
                There are a number of different types of positioning that you can put into effect on HTML elements. To
                make a specific type of positioning active on an element, we use the position property.

            <p>
                The multiple-column layout specification provides you with a method for laying content out in columns,
                as you might see in a newspaper. This article explains how to use this feature.
            </p>
            <p>Let's explore how to use multiple-column layout — often referred to as multicol. You can follow along by
                downloading the multicol starting point file and adding the CSS into the appropriate places. At the
                bottom of the section you can see an example of what the final code should look like.</p>

            <p>Responsive web design (RWD) is a web design approach to make web pages render well on all screen sizes
                and resolutions while ensuring good usability. It is the way to design for a multi-device web. In this
                article, we'll help you understand some techniques that can be used to master it.</p>
            <h3>Introducing responsive web design</h3>
            <p>HTML is fundamentally responsive, or fluid. If you create a web page containing only HTML, with no CSS,
                and resize the window, the browser will automatically reflow the text to fit the viewport.</p>
            <p>While the default responsive behavior may sound like no solution is needed, long lines of text displayed
                full screen on a wide monitor can be difficult to read. If wide screen line length is reduced with CSS,
                such as by creating columns or adding significant padding, the site may look squashed for the user who
                narrows their browser window or opens the site on a mobile device.</p>
            <code>
                @media screen and (min-width: 80rem) {
